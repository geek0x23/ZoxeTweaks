# ZoxeTweaks

This project really just exists to help me accomplish 3 goals:

  1. Make AtrocityUI more visible to me.  Fonts, chat panels, and a few other things here and there are just too small for me to see.  Details for this process can be found in the resolution-based text files in this repo.
  2. Fix WoW's absolutely busted scaling at 1440p.  When using a 1440p resolution with the appropriate pixel-perfect scale setting (~0.53), all the game's frames are very tiny and difficult to read.  I've written an addon to apply correct scales.
  3. Support ultrawide gaming at 3440 x 1440.  This is accomplished by checking the text files.  I have exact positions based on this resolution.

I have no desire to support other resolutions or other addons for scaling fixes.  This is a personal configuration + addon for my scenario, but I've shared it here because folks have asked me to on Atrocity's discord.  I'm not placing this on any addon sites.  I don't intend to fully support it that way.  This is just me sharing my setup with you.

Lastly, I have not completely scaled every frame in the game.  I've just been scaling them as I encounter them.  I will update this code as I encounter more.
